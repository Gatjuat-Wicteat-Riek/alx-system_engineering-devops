0x19. Postmortem
Overview
This project focuses on identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues within a web stack, simulating real-world scenarios where web applications may experience outages or performance degradation. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and implement corrective measures to prevent future incidents.

Postmortem Summary
Incident: Web Server Misconfiguration
Duration: 2 hours (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM UTC)
Impact: 60% of users experienced slow loading times and service disruptions
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in load balancer settings leading to uneven traffic distribution
Key Learnings
Issue Detection: Monitoring tools detected increased response times.
Root Cause Analysis: Initial assumptions about database issues were incorrect; investigation revealed load balancer misconfiguration.
Resolution: Corrected load balancer settings and performed system audits.
Preventative Measures: Enhanced monitoring, automated testing, and team training.
Files
postmortem.md: Detailed postmortem report of the incident.
config/: Directory containing configuration files used in the investigation.
logs/: Log files relevant to the incident, useful for understanding the system behavior during the outage.
scripts/: Automation scripts for testing and deployment used during resolution.
docs/: Documentation on best practices for server and load balancer configurations.
How to Use This Project
